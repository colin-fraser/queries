# Keep a library of parameterized queries

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

I have a number of parameterized SQL queries that I run regularly. The purpose of this package is to keep canonical versions of those queries with standardized parameterization. It uses the `glue` package to replace parameters.

## Usage

The package reads modified sql files that have metadata stored in yaml format in a comment block at the top. Here's a simple example: start with a file like this saved as `/path/to/queries/sales_by_group.sql`.

```
-- name: Sales by group
-- description: an example query. Try running with group_by set to country. If
--  the description is really long you can just continue on the next line with a
--  single-space indent.
-- params:
--   - dimensions: columns to group by
--   - metrics: metrics to compute for each dimension

SELECT {comma_join(metrics)}, {comma_join(dimensions)}
FROM Customers
GROUP BY {comma_join(dimensions)}

```

Having set `options(default_queries_location = '/path/to/queries')`, I can run

```
query_substitute('sales_by_group', metrics = c('SUM(Sales)', 'AVG(Sales)'), dimensions = c('Country', 'Segment'), query_location = 'tests/testthat') %>% cat
-- name: example
-- description: an example query. Try running with group_by set to country. If
--  the description is really long you can just continue on the next line with a
--  single-space indent.
-- params:
--   - dimensions: columns to group by
--   - metrics: metrics to compute for each dimension

SELECT SUM(Sales), AVG(Sales), Country, Segment
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country, Segment
```

## Big picture usage

### Query Library

I use this in two ways. First, I have a library of queries stored in a repositoryâ€”say `~/projects/path/to/queries`. These are canonical versions of parameterized queries that my team uses. In my .Rprofile, I have a line that sets the default query location to that path

`options(default_queries_location='~/projects/path/to/queries')`

Which contains files

- `sales_by_group.sql`
- `customer_list.sql`
- etc...

Whenever I need to run one of these queries, I build the query with

`q <- load_query('sales_by_group')`

If I don't remember all the parameters, I can view the header with `head`:

```head(q)
 # name: example
 # description: an example query. Compute metrics grouped by dimensions. If
 #  the description is really long you can just continue on the next line with a
 #  single-space indent.
 # params:
 #   - dimensions: A character vector of columns to group by
 #   - metrics: A character vector of metrics to compute.
```

### R Projects
The other way that I use this is to store bespoke queries in a `/sql` directory in an R project. `load_query` will look for a `/sql` directory first, then check whether the `default_query_location` option is set up.

## Installation

Install with devtools:

``` r
devtools::install_github("colin-fraser/queries")
```
